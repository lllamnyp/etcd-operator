# etcd-operator

A Kubernetes operator for running [etcd](https://etcd.io/) clusters. Status: **early alpha** — API is `lllamnyp.su/v1alpha2` and will likely change.

## What it does

The operator manages etcd clusters via two custom resources:

- **`EtcdCluster`** — what the user creates. Captures cluster-wide intent: replica count, etcd version, per-member storage size, a progress deadline.
- **`EtcdMember`** — what the operator creates. One per etcd member. Owns its Pod and PVC. Operator-managed; users should not edit these directly.

There is no StatefulSet. Each member's Pod and PVC are reconciled independently so the operator can model protocol-aware lifecycle (learner-mode joins, member-id assignment, graceful removal, scale-to-zero pause/resume) without fighting StatefulSet's "all replicas are one workload" assumption.

The full design rationale is in [docs/concepts.md](docs/concepts.md).

## What's supported today

- **Bootstrap** of new clusters. Single seed first, learner-mode adds afterwards.
- **Scale up / down**: cluster controller adds members one at a time as learners and promotes them; scale-down picks the most-recently-created member, runs `MemberRemove` via a finalizer, then GCs the Pod and PVC.
- **Scale to zero (pause/resume)**: `spec.replicas: 0` parks the surviving member via `spec.dormant=true`; the Pod is deleted, the PVC stays owned by the `EtcdMember`. Scaling back up to ≥ 1 flips `spec.dormant=false` on the same member; etcd resumes from the existing data dir with the same cluster ID and member ID.
- **Pod restart / node failure**: data PVC is preserved, the new Pod reads the existing WAL and rejoins with the same member ID.
- **Memory-backed storage (opt-in)**: `spec.storageMedium: Memory` switches each member's data dir to a tmpfs `emptyDir` whose lifetime is bound to the Pod. Members that lose their Pod (eviction, node failure) lose their data; the operator detects this, removes the member from etcd, and replaces it via the existing scale-up path. Suits scenarios where the etcd state is reconstructable and replication absorbs single-member losses. Production hardening (PDB / anti-affinity / resource defaults) is not auto-emitted — see [docs/concepts.md](docs/concepts.md#storage) and issue [#16](https://github.com/lllamnyp/etcd-operator/issues/16).
- **Apiserver-enforced validation**: CEL rules on the CRD (k8s 1.29+) reject `replicas: 0` with `storageMedium: Memory`, `storage: 0` with `storageMedium: Memory`, `storageMedium` changes after creation, and `storage` shrinks. No webhook / cert-manager dependency.
- **Locking pattern**: `status.observed` snapshots the in-flight target so mid-flight spec edits don't corrupt consensus; `progressDeadline` bounds how long the operator will spend trying to reach a target.
- **Cluster deletion**: cascading owner refs clean up everything; finalizers detect "the whole cluster is going away" and skip etcd-side removal to avoid deadlock.

## What's not supported (yet)

No TLS. No auth/RBAC inside etcd. No in-place version upgrades (changing `spec.version` only affects newly-created members). No PVC resizing — see [#2](https://github.com/lllamnyp/etcd-operator/issues/2). No automatic broken-member replacement for PVC-backed clusters (memory-backed members do auto-replace on Pod loss; `status.brokenMembers` reads 0 in practice — see [docs/concepts.md](docs/concepts.md#storage)). No backups, no defragmentation scheduling, no PodAntiAffinity by default. See the [issue tracker](https://github.com/lllamnyp/etcd-operator/issues) for the running follow-up list.

## Quick start

```sh
# 1. Install CRDs and the operator. Builds an image and pushes it to your
#    registry; substitute IMG= for a prebuilt tag if you have one. The cluster
#    must be able to pull from <your-registry> — for local clusters (kind /
#    minikube / k3d) sideload the image or use an ephemeral registry such as
#    ttl.sh, otherwise the operator Deployment will sit in ImagePullBackOff.
make install
make docker-build docker-push deploy IMG=<your-registry>/etcd-operator:<tag>

# 2. Create a cluster.
cat <<'EOF' | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: lllamnyp.su/v1alpha2
kind: EtcdCluster
metadata:
  name: my-etcd
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 3
  version: 3.5.17
  storage: 1Gi
EOF

# 3. Wait for ready and inspect.
kubectl get etcdcluster.lllamnyp.su my-etcd -w
POD=$(kubectl get pod -l etcd.lllamnyp.su/cluster=my-etcd \
  -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl exec -it "$POD" -- etcdctl --endpoints=http://localhost:2379 \
  member list -w table
```

Member names are apiserver-assigned (`GenerateName="<cluster>-"`) — don't hard-code them; use the cluster label selector.

For step-by-step setup, RBAC, image versions, and teardown see [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md).

## Documentation

- **[Installation](docs/installation.md)** — deploy the operator, create your first cluster, networking pitfalls, upgrades.
- **[Concepts](docs/concepts.md)** — design rationale: locking pattern, single-seed bootstrap, GenerateName naming, scale-to-zero mechanics, conditions reference.
- **[Operations](docs/operations.md)** — runbook for day-2: scaling, pausing/resuming, decoding conditions, escalating stuck reconciles, broken-member recovery.

## Testing

```sh
go test ./controllers/...
```

The suite uses controller-runtime's fake client and a fake etcd client; no envtest assets needed at the unit level. Pinned behaviours:

- **Bootstrap** — single-seed creation, idempotent recovery, `GenerateName`-assigned names.
- **Locking pattern** — `status.observed` / `progressDeadline` lock the in-flight target; bootstrap-deadline is terminal.
- **Scale up** — learner-mode add, readiness gate before the next step, crash-recovery branches between `Create` / `MemberAddAsLearner` / `Patch(initialCluster)`.
- **Scale down** — `CreationTimestamp` DESC (name DESC tiebreak) victim selection, finalizer-driven `MemberRemove`.
- **Scale to zero** — 1→0 Patches `spec.dormant=true`; 0→1 flips it back; dormant member's Pod is gone but its PVC is preserved.
- **Discovery** — seed found via `spec.bootstrap=true`; etcd client endpoints filtered to voters (`MemberReady=True`) so `MemberList` doesn't route to a learner.
- **Status no-churn** — steady-state reconciles don't repeatedly mutate status.
